    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of
      coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream
      of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always
      requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to
      keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if
      desired. Feliz Navidad!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white rum</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over
        simmering water. Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly,
        until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a
        temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed
        milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; blend until combined,
        about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator; serve
        cold or over ice, if desired.
